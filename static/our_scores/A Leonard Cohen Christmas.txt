A Leonard Cohen Christmas
=========================

Music and Lyrics by Pelayo Matute


It's a windy day down in Notre Dame
And the shopping malls all look the same
And a hunger for the past hangs in the air

While the busy shoppers park and fly
All the little children scream and cry
Because Santa smells of whis-ky and despair

And the boys all play with their bats and balls
As the window dressers deck the halls
While the Moslem cabbies drive the drunk accountants to the restaurant
It's Christmas-time
(repeat)


Now the cartoon songs that the TV sings
Of the drummer boys and the reindeer
Bring back the memories she's trying to suppress

Of the creepy uncle with the 'stache
As he gets too touchy when he's trashed
And spills unholy eggnog on her dress

And the young girls dance in their Santa hats
While the old men play with their balls and bats
And the jews are eating egg foo yong
And going to a lousy film on Christmas Day
(repeat)

On Christmas Day!
