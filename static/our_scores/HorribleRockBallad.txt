Baby you know that I'm lyin' here alone
And I'm achin' inside just to pick up the phone
There's no shelter from the storm when you're so far away
How can I live another day?

Drinking my pain from this bottle of wine
When you're feeling numb it's like feeling fine
But now I'm down on my knees and I'm begging you please
Won't you bring it on home?

CHORUS:
'Cause I'm a train wreck on the highway of love
Won't you save me like heaven above
(x2)

Cryin’ my tears in in this dirty motel
Another one night stand that leaves me feeling like hell
See the city lights baby burnin’ bright
How can I live another night?

Out on the road, there's no place to call home
It's been too many miles to be riding alone
And now I'm feeling the squeeze, it's got me down on my knees
I've got to bring it on home...

CHORUS
