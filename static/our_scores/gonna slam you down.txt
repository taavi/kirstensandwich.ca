Doo, do-doo, do-doo... etc.

I'm gonna slam you down
  like an angry freestyle rapper
gonna slam you down
  like a douchey finger-snapper
gonna slam you down
  like an emo kid who has no friends

I'm gonna slam you down
  like a ranting poser hipster
gonna slam you down
  like a bohemian drifter
gonna slam you down
  even if I'm hard to comprehend

I'm gonna make your ears bleed with my dub poetry
'Cause I'm a third-rate Linton Kwesi Johnson wannabee
I'm gonna slam you down, gonna slam you down

I'm gonna slam you down
  with my vintage shirt and bolo
gonna slam you down
  with a nasty beat box solo

  *beat box solo fiasco*

"They've done this at EVERY rehearsal."

Doo, do-doo, do-doo... etc.

I'm gonna bore your captive audience and hijack your show
'Cause I'm a shitty stand-up comic with nowhere to go
I'm gonna slam you down, gonna slam you down

I'm gonna slam you down
  when you hear me talking talkin' dirty
gonna slam you down
  even though I'm sounding nerdy
I'm gonna slam you down
  like a heavyweight from UFC

I'm gonna slam you down
  with my battle of the sexes
gonna slam you down
  when I scream about my exes
I'm gonna slam you down
  and what my messed-up parents did to me

And if you're keeping score and you give me a six
'Cause you're a racist homophobic patricarchal dick
Gonna slam you down again, slam you down again
Slam you down again, slam you down again.
Slam you down again!
